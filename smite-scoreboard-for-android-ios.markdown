These apps allow players of the popular garden game **‘Smite‘** to keep track of their scores without the need for endless pieces of paper.

The concept of the game is similar to skittles where players take turns to throw a wooden ‘smitter’ at wooden pins. The aim of the game is to score exactly 50 points and the scoring means that this isn’t as simple as it may sound.

### Current Features:

- Player entry with photo avatars
- Multi-player mode
- Auto Saving of Game State to resume later
- Team mode – Added in 2.0.1032 (Jan 2020)
- Undo Score - Added in 2.2.1357 (Jun 2021)

### Potential Future Features:

- Save players and games into ‘Game History’
- Player statistics
- Sound effects (because we all love a sad trombone!)

You will need to be running Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) and above or iOS 9.0 and above to install the app on your device.

Unfortuntely the 'Original Smite' store has now closed down but you can find plenty of other outlets offering Smite sets at reasonable prices - just make sure you search for 'smite garden game' rather than just 'smite'.

### Privacy Policy
You can read about what data is collected and what I do with it in the <a href="{{ "/smite-scoreboard-privacy" | relative_url }}">Privacy Policy</a>. Don't worry, because the app collects practically nothing and only diagnostic data ever leaves your device there isn't much to read here.
