These apps allow players of the popular garden game <a href='http://www.originalsmite.com/' target='_blank'>â€˜Smiteâ€˜</a> to keep track of their scores without the need for endless pieces of paper.

The concept of the game is similar to skittles where players take turns to throw a wooden â€˜smitterâ€™ at wooden pins. The aim of the game is to score exactly 50 points and the scoring means that this isnâ€™t as simple as it may sound.

### Current Features:

- Player entry with photo avatars
- Multi-player mode
- Auto Saving of Game State to resume later
- Team mode â€“ Added in 2.0.1032 (Jan 2020)

### Potential Future Features:

- Save players and games into â€˜Game Historyâ€™
- Player statistics
- Sound effects (because with all love a sad trombone!)

You will need to be running Android 4.1 (Jelly Bean) and above or iOS 9.0 and above to install the app on your device.
