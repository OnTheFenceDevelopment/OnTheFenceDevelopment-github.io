They say that life is what you make it so time to make some resolutions …… yes?

Well, if <a href='https://simpleprogrammer.com/' target='_blank'>John Sonmez from Simple Programmer</a> is to be believed – maybe not!

I receive regular email updates from the Simple Programmer website and the one I received on 27th December caused me to stop and think.

Probably based on <a href='https://simpleprogrammer.com/how-to-win-in-the-new-year/' target='_blank'>one of John’s blogs posts from 2016</a>, the subject of the email was ‘Dont make resolutions the New Year, make a commitment’. Now I initially thought that these amounted to the same thing but changed my mind after reading the parting shot of the email which read:

>Let me put it this way, when you need to take a taxi to the airport, do you want your taxi driver to resolve to be there at 8:30 AM or do you want him to commit to being there at that time?

The answer is obvious (hopefully) so I’ve decided to make some commitments for 2018:

- I will watch at least one Pluralsight course a month
    - My technology focus will be .NET Core, Azure, ReactJs
- I will watch at least one Xamarin University session (attending those required to maintain my certification)
- I will blog twice a month (not including the Online Tool of the Month posts)
    - To keep me honest I will probably post findings from my Pluralsight courses and Xamarin investigations (proving that I’ve actually honoured the above commitments)
    - Other topics will include Privacy and Encryption which seem to be bad words these days

So that’s what I will commit to this year – maybe I’ll be in a position to commit to more but I’ll review my progress mid-2018 and see how I’m doing.
