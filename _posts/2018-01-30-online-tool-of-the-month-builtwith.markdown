Have you ever looked at a website and thought ‘I wonder what that’s written in’? Well, even if you haven’t I certainly have which is why I was interested to hear about <a href='https://builtwith.com/' target='_blank'>BuiltWith</a>.

Simply put, BuiltWith puts websites under the microscope and produces a detailed report about what it sees.

From Webservers and SSL Certificate providers through programming languages, Javascript libraries, content management systems and advertising platforms it sees it all. The produced report contains links to allow you to see technology trends across the Internet which may well assist with infrastructure decisions for your next project.

<a href='https://builtwith.com/onthefencedevelopment.com' target='_blank'>Pointing BuiltWith at this site</a> I was able to see that not only were the current technologies being listed, including the current version numbers where applicable, but it also reported that 56 technologies had been removed since July 2012 (I migrated from SquareSpace to WordPress fairly recently).

Registering for a free account would allow me to see much more detail and view historical data but for now I have found the open version sufficient for my needs.
