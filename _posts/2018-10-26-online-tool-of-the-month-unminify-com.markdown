Minification and bundling of Javascript and CSS files is obviously a good idea when you are deploying your websites to production â€“ but if you want to use a third-party, minified, resource and want/need to look at the unminified version â€“ it can be a bit of a pain.

I recently purchased a theme for a website which came as a set of CSS, Javascript and image files. There were a number of pages which demonstrated the theme and it was pretty much what I wanted â€“ but not quite, I needed to make a few very minor changes.

These changes were limited to styles which specified â€˜hero blocksâ€™ with image backgrounds. I didnâ€™t need a block with an aircraft in the background â€“ I needed one with a camper van.

Now I could have simply renamed my images to match the existing assets, but when they are called something like â€˜airplane_x500.pngâ€˜ I donâ€™t think thatâ€™s a great idea. I certainly would not do it in code â€“ create a class file called airplane.cs and implement a camper van inside it!

So, I needed to update the CSS â€“ and herein lies the rub. The CSS file in question was minified (others did have the original version in the bundle â€“ this one did not).

I could have contacted the designer and request the unminified asset but I really didnâ€™t want to go through the hassle of this with no guarantee of receiving the file.

Enter <a href='https://unminify.com/' target='_blank'>Unminify.com</a>, a simple website which does exactly what it says itâ€™s going to to â€“ take minified resources and reverse the minification process.

The UI is pretty simple and self explanatory â€“ simply paste your minified text into the central text area....
