Iâ€™ve been developing with Xamarin for a few years now and most of the time I do so using Visual Studio. Now, as with most technologies, Xamarin is constantly evolving and therefore updates are pushed out fairly frequently â€“ thatâ€™s all good, we all like new stuff donâ€™t we?

Well, Iâ€™ve always had a problem whereby Visual Studio would prompt me to say that there was an update available and that I should â€˜Click Here to Updateâ€™ â€“ the only problem being that this doesnâ€™t actually do anything!
<!--more-->
In the past Iâ€™ve simply opened up Xamarin Studio, checked for and installed updates and then reopened Visual Studio â€“ simple itâ€™s a bit irritating.

Well with Xamarin now being part of Microsoft and after rebuilding my development workstation I find that Xamarin Studio is no longer installed with the rest of the Xamarin components when Visual Studio is installed. So how do I install the updates now?

Well, after <a href='https://forums.xamarin.com/discussion/comment/213310' target='_blank'>posting that very question in the Xamarin Forums</a> I was guided to the answer which seems so obvious now (thatâ€™s sarcasm by the way). I simply needed to navigate to: Tools > Options > Xamarin > Other > Check Now

Donâ€™t know how I missed that ðŸ˜‰

Anyway â€“ <a href='https://bugzilla.xamarin.com/show_bug.cgi?id=38753' target='_blank'>the bug with the notification looks like itâ€™s fixed now</a> but just in case I thought Iâ€™d post this here for the unwary.
