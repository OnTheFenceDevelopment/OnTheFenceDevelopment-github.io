I’ve been contracting for over seven years now and during that time I’ve had  a number of clients, friends fellow contractors ask me “…why ‘On The Fence‘? What’s that all about??”.

Ignoring the fact that the blog I initially hosted on this domain was about my experiences with Linux and Open Source while working day to day as a .NET Developer using Windows, I think that the name fits – it’s all about not putting all your eggs in one basket as it were.

I think that there is quite a wide line between trying to be a ‘Jack of All Trades’ and a ‘One Trick Pony’ and as a Contractor I think that this is a good place to be.

Some will disagree, Jon Sonmez of Simple Programmer certainly <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xeg-4RrSUk4' target='_blank'>advocates specialising</a> and he’s retired in his 30’s so maybe I’m the one who’s wrong here. But while I can see the merits in this approach and it worked out well for Jon, I don’t think that being ‘the expert in the <a href='https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/xamarin/xamarin-forms/user-interface/layouts/grid' target='_blank'>Xamarin.Forms Grid control</a>‘ is going to get me that far (that’s not to say that the Grid control is a trivial thing of course).

I also don’t think that trying to be a Guru in Desktop, Web and Mobile development  is viable either. We all know that this would be virtually impossible to achieve with the technology shifting under us all the time.

I do however think that to be a viable option as a contractor you need a good foundation knowledge, spread of skills across various technologies and a desire to learn as you go (let’s face it – nobody can know it all).

So that’s what I aim for.

I have experience with Desktop development using WinForms, WPF and am starting to look at UWP.

On the Web development front I am currently working with a client who has an ASP.NET WebForms application and another using MVC while a freelance project has me ramping up on ASP.NET MVC Core development on a Linux host.

With Mobile development I am all Xamarin, whether it’s the native flavours for Android and iOS or Xamarin.Forms. Hooking these up to Azure (or ASP.NET WebAPI Core) backend is also within my skillset.

I’m always looking to keep my skills up to date, while able to support existing deployments using older technologies – and even migrate them forwards should that be the desire.
