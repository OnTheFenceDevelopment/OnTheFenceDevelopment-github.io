Back in June I announced that I was ‘<a href='2020-06-01-thats-all-folks' target='_blank'>pulling the pin</a>‘ on the limited company I had been contracting through for the previous nine years. At the end of that post I said that although I hadn’t found a permanent role I was hoping to do so in the near future – well, I’m happy to say that I didn’t have to wait too long.

Completely out of the blue I received a message on LinkedIn from a previous client. They had noticed that I was looking for a permanent role and wondered if I would consider returning to work for them.

Well, three months on and I’m about to (hopefully) complete my probation period and become a full employee.

Looking back at my time as a contractor I can honestly say that I don’t regret a thing about it. I have worked with numerous clients, in numerous sectors with numerous technologies. While some were more enjoyable than others I believe I learned something from each engagement – even if that was how something shouldn’t be done or a technology that was more trouble than it was worth.

It’s no secret that contractors turning perm are quite sought after and this experience is one of the reasons for that.

But this isn’t a one way street and I was pleasantly surprised by the package that was offered, over and above a healthy salary – which may not be quite what I was used to while I was contracting, but the additional benefits such as medical expense cover, bonuses and pension it’s coming pretty close.

It was an easy decision to make to return. They have a great team, a great product and a great vision. They understand the importance of keeping the code base clean and the technologies up to date.

What more could a developer want.?
