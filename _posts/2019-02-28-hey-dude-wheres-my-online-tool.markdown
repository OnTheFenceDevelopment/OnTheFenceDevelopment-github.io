Over the past 18 months I’ve been posting details of various online tools that I’ve encountered – but not this month I’m afraid.

Why? Well, frankly I’ve run out! I’ve got nothing!

I’ve been hard at work but haven’t actually found the need for an online tool that I haven’t used before.

Now that’s not to say that there aren’t any tools out there – it’s just that I didn’t need them, not this month anyway.
Next month may be different but I think it’s probably best to drop the ‘of the month’ banner and just categorise them as ‘Online Tool’
