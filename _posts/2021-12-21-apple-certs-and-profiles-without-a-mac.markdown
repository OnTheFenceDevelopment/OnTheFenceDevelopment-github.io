I think we will all agree that the annual chore of regenerating signing certificates and provisioning profiles for our iOS project is just that â€“ a chore. Not only do we have to remember the dance that we performed the year before but also need to dust off the Mac Mini and hope it boots.

But why a Mac Mini? Why are we tied to using Apple hardware to generate our certificate signing request and to export the resulting certificate in the correct format?

Well, as it turns out â€¦.. we donâ€™t, we can in fact use Windows 10 using built in tooling.

### Generating a Certificate Request (aka CSR)

If you were using a Mac you would open the Keychain to create your CSR, in Windows 10 you can use the Certificate Manager to do the same thing.

Â» Enter â€˜certificatesâ€™ into the taskbar search box and select the â€˜Manage computer certificatesâ€™ option

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-1.png)

Â» Next select the **Personal** folder

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-2.png)

Â» Then select **Action > All Tasks > Advanced Operations > Create Custom Request** from the main menu and click Next to skip the **Welcome** page

### Select Certificate Enrollment Policy

Â» Ensure **Proceed without enrollment policy** is selected

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-3.png)

Â» Click Next

### Custom Request

Â» Set the template as **No Template** and ensure the Request format is **PKCS #10**

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-4.png)

Â» Click Next

### Certificate Information

Â» Click the Details expander and then properties

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-5.png)

### Certificate Properties

Â» On the **General** tab enter a **Friendly Name** and **Description** (not sure where this is used in the process)

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-6.png)

Â» On the **Subject** tab within the **Subject Name** panel, select the **Common Name** item from the **Type** dropdown, enter a Value and click **Add** to include the parameter

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-7.png)

Â» On the **Extensions** tab expand the **Key Usage** section then Select and Add the following items:

- Digital Signature
- Key Certificate Signing

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-8.png)

Â» On the **Private Key** tab expand the **Key Options** section and set the **Key Size** to `2048`. Also tick the **Make private key exportable** option

Â» Still on the **Private Key** tab, expand the **Select Hash Algorithm** and select `sha256`

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-9.png)

Â» Click OK to commit these changes then click Next

### Save Certificate

Â» Finally enter a suitable filename and leave hte file format set to `Base 64`.

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-10.png)

Â» Click Finish

This CSR can now be used to generate the certificate on the Apple Developer portal and create a corresponding Provisioning Profile.

Once you have done so, download both to your local PC.

While the Provisioning Profile is ready to use we need to convert the .cer file that we downloaded into a .p12 file that can be used by systems like DevOps and AppCenter.

### Importing your Apple Certificate

Â» Back in the **Windows Certificate Manager** and with the **Personal** folder selected select **Action > All Tasks > Import** from the main men then click Next to skip the **Welcome** screen.

### File to Import

Â» Click the Browse button to locate and select your downloaded certificate

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-11.png)

Â» Click Next

### Certificate Store

Â» Confirm the target location of certificate as **Personal**

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-12.png)

Â» Click Next then **Finish** to complete the import

If you now select the **Certificates** folder within **Personal** you should see the shiny new certificate

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-13.png)

Right, now they we have imported it â€¦ we need to export it again so that we can use it ðŸ˜‰

### Exporting the P12 Certificate

Â» With the new certificate selected select **Action > All Tasks > Export** from the main menu and click Next to get past the Welcome screen

### Export Private Key

Â» Select **Yes, export the private key** option

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-14.png)

Â» Click Next

### Export File Format

My system only seems to allow me to export as `PKCS #12` format (which is lucky as thatâ€™s what we need) and I select the following options:

- Export all extended properties
- Enable certificate privacy

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-15.png)

Â» Click Next

### Security

Â» Tick the Password checkbox then type and repeat your password and select **TripleDES-SHA1** as the Encryption method (yes, this seems to fly in the face of the sha256 value we specified in the CSR but if you pick **AES256-SHA256** option we will probably get an error when you try to use build your app).

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-16.png)

Â» Click Next

### File to Export

Â» Use the Browse button to select your desired output location and filename, then click Next

![TBA](/assets/images/apple-certs-17.png)

Â» Finally click Finish to complete the export process

Note that the saved file has a **.pfx** extension which most systems wonâ€™t accept â€“ despite the file being perfectly valid so you will need to change this to **.p12** and you are done.

Using your newly exported **.p12** certificate and your provisioning profile you can now sign your iOS builds using DevOps or AppCenter â€“ all withough a Mac in sight.
