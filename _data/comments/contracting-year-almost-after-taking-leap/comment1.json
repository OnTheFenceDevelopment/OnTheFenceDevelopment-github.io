I’ve been thinking about this for a few months now, but am still afraid to make the move (yet).<br>I’d appreciate if you can blog about the kind of legal details one needs to be aware of – any information/pointers that you can provide would be very helpful for people like me who are thinking of going into full time contracting position.<br>Best luck."
