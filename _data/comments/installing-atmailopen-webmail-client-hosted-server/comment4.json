    "message": "I installed atMail in the root of my website (htdocs) in a folder called ‘mail’. This was really just so that I could navigate to it using http://mydomain.com/mail. If you have multiple domains then there must still be a ‘root’ folder for each one, e.g. where the index.html/default.html files will reside. Installing here will provide a similar access URL to mine.<br>The fact is that atMail can be hosted anywhere as it just accesses the Inbox based on the mailserver + credentials provided – you could theoretically host it on your desktop.<br>I didn’t integrate this with WordPress in any way so i can’t help you on that one."
