    "message": "I am looking at the same problem, but I want to go a step further than you did, and hide the Language and Protocol fields as well – the package is only available in English, and my users are not going to know what Protocol is, and they don’t read the instructions.<br>The trouble is, being fields they can’t be simply replaced by fields – Javascript is expecting theForm.Language.options[theForm.Language.selectedIndex].value to be valid.<br>Can you think of a way around this ?"
