    "message": "Hi Dave,I think I stopped where I did for the same reason, there maybe a simple workaround but I didn’t need to pursue it, I was able to just tell my user to leave those fields alone.<br>I’ve not looked at the code for that page for quite a while now and the account/domain I configured this on is now dormant so i have nothing to test with but if I was looking at it now I would probably see if I could limit the options in the dropdown lists to just the default value in each and then hide the control itself.<br>Sorry I can’t be any more help – you could always post something on Stackoverflow (www.stackoverflow.com) or even contact AtOpenMail about it – this product is Open Source after all."
