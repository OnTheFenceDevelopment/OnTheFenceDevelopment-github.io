    "message": "Interesting post Dave. I’ve spoken to a huge number of contractors that share your experiences. It’s a pity that you have to be so careful in what information you divulge to Recruiters. Most I’ve talked to are also very frustrated by their rate ‘negotiation’.I’m currently doing a quick survey on the way tech recruiters contact you. It only takes a minute or two to fill out and its open to IT Professionals in Ireland and the UK – feel free to fill it out and share – **http://roleconnect.polldaddy.com/s/recruitercontact-survey**"
