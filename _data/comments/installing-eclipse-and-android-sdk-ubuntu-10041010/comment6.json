    "message": "Hello,<br>A simple addition : This whole process requires you to have Java5 SDK installed. So, for that you need to edit your sources.list file. Open up the terminal and type in “sudo nano /etc/apt/sources.list” . And at the end of the file, add this “deb http://us.archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/ jaunty main multiverse universe restricted” . And then save it and close the text editor. Now in the terminal, type > sudo apt-get update. After that >sudo apt-get install sun-jva5-jdk.<br>Hope this helps! ! Cheers to Dave! !<br>Regard,<br>Kalpak Khemka."
