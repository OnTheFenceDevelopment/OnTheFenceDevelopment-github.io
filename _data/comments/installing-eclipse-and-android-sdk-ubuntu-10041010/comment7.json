    "message": "Thanks for the information Kalpak – however I think I have the OpenJDK v6 installed – I’ll have a look and make sure, good to know all the options.<br>I certainly don’t recall updating my sources.list file – but I may be having a senior moment at this end<br>[Update: Yep, only the OpenJDK v6 installed here and it looks like I did it from the Ubuntu Software Centre not via apt-get, so no update required in sources.list. Note that I have not really developed anything in Android in anger yet so I might find that the OpenJDK is not up to the task]"
