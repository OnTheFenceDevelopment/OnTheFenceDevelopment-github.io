    "message": "Thanks for the article. Seems that that Android SDK manage has a new look in its latest version. See http://developer.appcelerator.com/blog/2011/10/googles-new-android-sdk-tools-revision-14.html for a write-up.I had to go back and install Android SDK Platform-tools after installing the APIs. Seemed to work after that."
