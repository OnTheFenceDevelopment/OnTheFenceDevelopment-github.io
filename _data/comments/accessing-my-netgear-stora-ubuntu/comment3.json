    "message": "I was happy to find this as I too am an Ubuntu user and had been fooled by the Netgear claims about Linux compatability.<br>Finally got a chance to set up the stora last night, and once the set up was done via the wife’s windows pc, I went to one of my ubuntu machines, and low and behold, there was the stora available via Network/workgroup. I was able to access files, write files, rename folders, and transfer files all around the home LAN. This was working on both Maverick and Natty.I was also able to add the folders as sources in XBMC…. Happy Days!!"
