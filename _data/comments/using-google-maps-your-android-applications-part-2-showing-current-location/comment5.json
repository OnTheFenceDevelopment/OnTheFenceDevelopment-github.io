    "message": "Hi Tika, That’s really odd – I’ve just downloaded the project, added my maps key and the maps are being displayed. If they are not displaying for you then I suspect a configuration issue at your end.<br>Things to check are: do you have an internet connection, have you changed the keystore (you’ll know if you changed it) that you are building against, have you pasted the maps key in correctly?<br>Try regenerating a key as detailed in part 1 – is it the same as before?<br>Let me know how you get on – I’ll do what I can to help."
