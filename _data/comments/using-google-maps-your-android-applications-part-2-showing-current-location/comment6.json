    "message": "I have internet connection, never changed keystore, and pasted the maps key correctly.Finaly I uninstalled android sdk and reinstalled again. I use ADT Bundle for windows. Create new android project and generate MD5 fingerprint, generate api key. And the result is same.it just display blinking marker. map is not displayed. It is so frustating. Is it because of Google Maps Android v1 API (Deprecated)? Should I use google maps android v2 api?"
