    "message": "When I was testing this code I did try it out while I was driving and the blue dot did follow my location â€“ the map re-centred when the dot reached the edge of the display. With the other location listeners it is possible to set the update rate but Iâ€™m not sure if this is the case with the MyLocation overlay â€“ i think it just does it but I could be wrong.<br>Let me know how you get on and Iâ€™ll see if I can install this version of the project onto my phone at some point and see if it does what I think it does ðŸ˜‰"
