    "message": "Thanks for your feedback – although, like you, I can only speak as I find. Yes I’ve had a few problems with my CoPilot but not so much that I want to replace it with something else.I read equally mixed reviews about Navigon when I was looking but I had to make a choice. I chose CoPilot and yes I have had some problems – but nothing major. The system guided me across France and back home so for me it did the job I bought it for – your mileage may vary "
