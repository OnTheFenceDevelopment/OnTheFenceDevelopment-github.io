    "message": "Hi, I’ve been a long time user of Co pilot but on a pda rather than a phone. I am now trying to get used to the idea of online gps systems which seem like a big grab for data usage from the internet providers.<br>The version I have is Copilot 5 and worked really well as it came with the device as a separete SD card that worked on windows mobile on a 300MHz processor.<br>The unit had not option for internet unless I used wifi which is useless on the move.<br>anyway, The software worked great for years and my only frustration was that after purchasing a RDS decoder that plugs to the Mio PDA, I find that copilot had greyed out the traffic information menu that was transmitted on FM radio via RDS.<br>So even for these updates of weather, accidents etc.. you ought not to need internet because it is transmitted on the FM radio uas RDS. Well time has moved on and now the smartphones use the internet to produce all the gps things we can actually get for free.<br>I’d venture a guess that the FM signal is more consistent than the internet signal on portable devices.<br>Hmmm I wonder if my co pilot from windows can actually be run on android, probably not ."
