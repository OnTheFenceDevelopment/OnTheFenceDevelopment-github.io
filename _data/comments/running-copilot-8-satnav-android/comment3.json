    "message": "I have a new HTC Desire and I was hoping to transfer my TomTom Navigator 7 to it, unfortunately TomTom do not have support for Androids so I purchased CoPilot 8.Apart from a few installation problems which have been sorted by CoPilot’s Technical service I am very pleased with it. The CoPilot starts up in a few seconds and the Satellites register in about 15 seconds, (this is realy fast compared to TomTom which can take anything up to 10 minutes). The maps I purchased for £57 cover the EU are very sharp and the navigation is very good. The same maps from TomTom are about 3 times as much."
