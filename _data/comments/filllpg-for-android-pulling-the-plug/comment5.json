    "message": "Hello Developer…Luckily I had an old phone with your FillLPG app still on it and found you again…I am so happy and just want to tell you I have been admirer of your site since 2003 when I first started using LPG or maybe 2005 when I was in the Czech and you kindly allowed filling station in the EU to be added….in those days they was so few and so far apart it was scary!<br>Not sure if this is of interest to you but why dont you do FillEV so people with electric cars/vehicles can find places to fill up and keep FillLPG within that site..<br>The issue people have with all app is running VPN or total CHROME or other restrictions etc….very often nothing to with the developer..<br>Looking forward to seeing FillLPG on Web3 App Store!!<br>Also we would happily advertise on your site if that helps you with funds"
