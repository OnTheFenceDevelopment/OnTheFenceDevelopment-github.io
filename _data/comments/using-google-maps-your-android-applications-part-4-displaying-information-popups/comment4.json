    "message": "Hello Dave, I read your series about google maps. Today i have started to search some information for my google maps project. First of all your articles were very good. Thank you for that. I would like to know that, how can i display info about somewhere that user touched. You told in this article but it was getting info from a method. I mean that like in google map in a browser. As you know when you click on an object a bubble opens up that has information about that location. How can i get info directly from Google maps.. Thank you again. I have added your website to my favourites! "
