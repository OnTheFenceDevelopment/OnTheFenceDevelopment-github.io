    "message": "I switched to drupal a few months ago, and Iâ€™m satisfied totally. There are much more options in contrast to wp. Also, my data conversion was rather smooth, i used this tool fot importing **http://www.cms2cms.com/** It moved all the website elements except design and extensions, so i had to make it from scratch. But, now i really go well with Drupal"
