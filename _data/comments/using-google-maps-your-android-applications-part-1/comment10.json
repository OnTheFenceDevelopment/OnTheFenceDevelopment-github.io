    "message": "Ok, a quick Google and I found a few people mentioning that they needed to start the emulator with a -http-proxy switch to get things working behind a proxy. A quick search on the Android Developers site and I found this page (**http://developer.android.com/guide/developing/tools/emulator.html**) which details the command line switches for the emulator. Towards the bottom of the page, in the Network category, the definition for â€“http-proxy says<br><br> > Make all TCP connections through a specified HTTP/HTTPS proxy<br><br>Give that a whirl and let me know if it sorts your problem."
