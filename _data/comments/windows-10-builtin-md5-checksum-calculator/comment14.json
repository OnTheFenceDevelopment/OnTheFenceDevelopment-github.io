Yes, it’s not a bulletproof process, a hacker could in theory change both the file and the corresponding hash, but in that scenario all bets are off anyway! If an MD5 hash is provided then this is a simple way to check it against the downloaded file.<br><br><br>The built-in tool can also generate SHA256/384/512 hashes mentioned in the article you linked to – so there is value in knowing that you don’t have to install yet another third-party application to achieve this."
