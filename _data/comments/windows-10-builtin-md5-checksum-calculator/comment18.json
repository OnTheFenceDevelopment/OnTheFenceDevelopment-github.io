    "message": "I would agree with the fact that MD5 while having been broken, does not make it useless. Nothing is totally secure so security works on degrees of Risk. For your average download this is perfectly acceptable using MD5 “But” if your downloading Nuclear Codes, which I hope the average punter is not in the habit of doing, you might find this a little insecure of a consideration for MD5 and better routes to movement of that information would be a sound approach. Context is everything.. so if you are a bad actor target, a high degree of care and consideration are wise.. for us on the breadline with little to offer the bad actor except waste their time with low level banking and a handle on good password provision.. I believe we should consider our selves a little less special.."
