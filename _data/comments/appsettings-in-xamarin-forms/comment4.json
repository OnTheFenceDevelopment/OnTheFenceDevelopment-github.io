    "message": "In my real life implementations I normally have three configurations, Release, Staging and Debug so that’s probably why I habitually define the additional RELEASE and STAGING symbols. If you just have the two then yes, no need to overcomplicate things so just use the built-in DEBUG one.<br>Thanks for the heads up on the Login with Google issue – the site is hosted by WordPress.com so I’ll see if I can replicate it and raise a support ticket."
