    "message": "This is fantastic. Although as you say, is using reflexion. Is not a big deal is this case. But another solution like this but without reflection:<br>you can have an interface with the properties you want to configure and implement this interface for each environment.<br>Then, if you have dependency injection, you can inject the interface with the implementation, depending you environment. And thatâ€™s it, you can access to the parameters of you environment wherever you need.<br>To end with, if the repository is public, you should add this files to .gitignore.<br>Both solutions are totally fine, but the more you avoid reflection on xamarin projects, the better."
